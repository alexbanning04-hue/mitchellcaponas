      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Mitchell Caponas (b. 2002) is a Gadigal/Sydney-based artist whose practice weaves painterly abstraction with figuration, grounded in an exploration of colour – its intensity, its playfulness, and its performance. Caponas has majored in painting at The National Art School, Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2024. He exhibited at the NAS Graduate Art Show, 2024, selling two of his work and at a Goodspace Gallery, Sydney in Fluctuate 2025 group exhibition. Caponas also has worked at the Australian Bronze Company as a bronze castor on major projects including, bronze sculptures to be installed at the Sydney Fish Markets, Glebe Point Road, and the Sydney Metro. These projects cultivated Caponas’s current study of a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at UTS. Alongside being an artist, Caponas is a dedicated and disciplined rower, winning over the decade 12 national medals and 5 national championships in Australia.</p>
